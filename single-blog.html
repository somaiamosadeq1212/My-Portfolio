               <h2>Web designing</h2>
               <p>Web designing is the process of planning, creating, and structuring websites to meet specific goals, focusing on aesthetics, functionality,
                    and user experience. It encompasses various aspects like layout, navigation, visual elements (graphics, images, colors, fonts), 
                    and the overall user interface to ensure a positive and engaging experience for website visitors .</p>
               <img src="images/f.jpg" alt="">
               <p>Web design and web development include building sites with code. To code websites, you must know the basics of HTML and CSS.
                    You must also know web design coding languages like JavaScript and jQuery. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="single-blog">
                <h2>Web design is easy to use</h2>
                    <p>Web design is simple to learn, but it should also be easy to use. Study the designs of Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other successful websites. 
                        They all focus on the user rather than complicated layouts.</p>
                <img src="images/d.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Overdesign can include complicated navigation menus or annoying sidebar widgets. A good rule for web design is that your website should only be as complex as it needs to be.
                     Unless a design element has a specific function that isn’t carried out by anything else, it shouldn’t be there.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="single-blog">
                <h2>Web design is consistent</h2>
                <p>A big part of the user interface is the icons and buttons on a website. These include social media links, buy buttons, and more. A wide variety of free icon sets are available for designers. </p>
                <img src="images/l.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Web design can include learning a lot of code, but it does not have to be about code if that’s not your thing, and you can still design great websites. You can build websites with frameworks and content management systems.

                <h2>HTML: HyperText Markup Language</h2>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content..</p>
                <img src="images/a.jpg" alt="">
                <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web.</p>

            <div class="single-blog">
                <h2>CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
                <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of various parts
                     of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations..</p>
                <img src="images/b.png" alt="">
                <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, 
                    MathML or XHTML).</p>

                <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
                <p>Bootstrap is a free, open-source CSS framework that simplifies web development by providing pre-designed templates and reusable code for creating responsive websites.</p>
                <img src="images/g.jpg" alt="">
                <p>This framework helps developers build mobile-first and responsive websites efficiently by providing a foundation for layout and styling, allowing them to focus on content and functionality.</p>
